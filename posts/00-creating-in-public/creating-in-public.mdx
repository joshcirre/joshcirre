_It's a known fact that having accountability for the things you do, or plan on doing, is beneficial. However, no one really tells you how to do it._

## Creating in Public means taking risks.

It's risky to let someone know what you're planning on doing. You're being vulnerable. You're opening up. You're letting people see a side of you that you don't normally show.

But think of it this way: you're giving people the opportunity to follow up with you.

You're giving people a chance to check in.

You're sacrificing comfort and gaining company.

Here's three tips that I think creates a wonderful culture for creating in public.

1. Share everything. Even the things you don't want to.
2. Set due dates. Don't just show what you're working on. Say when you _hope_ to achieve those goals.
3. Follow up. Go through your tweets, your blog posts, your lists. What have you neglected? Start there.

Creating in public doesn't have to be scary. Sometimes it just means inviting people into your mind.
