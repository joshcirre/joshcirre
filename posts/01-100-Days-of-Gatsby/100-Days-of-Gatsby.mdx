### It's not about the time that you put into a project. It's about the time you dedicate to repetition and improvement.

<br />

I'm not the best developer. I'm not the best marketer. I'm not the best designer.

But I'm working at it constantly.

You never know what's going to happen. You never know when creativity is going to strike. You never know if today is the day when everything clicks. That's why repetition always wins. Because if you consistently create to the best of your ability every single day, then at the very least, you'll have a consistently high number of mediocre blog posts, products, songs, **insert whatever you're creating here**.

I'm not usually one for 100 days of blank. It's not usually in my wheelhouse, it's not what I'm looking to dedicate my time to right now, it's not for me, etc.
