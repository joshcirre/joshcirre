It's not about the time that you put into a project. It's about the time you dedicate to repetition and improvement.

I'm not the best developer. I'm not the best marketer. I'm not the best designer.

You never know what's going to happen. You never know when creativity is going to strike.
But it still happens and we still love it.

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: "#foo" })
  }
}
```
