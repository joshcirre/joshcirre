        ðŸ‘‹ Josh here. I am the founder of <a href="https://zimfy.co">Zimfy</a>, a product studio dedicated to crafting products that (<span class="italic">mostly</span>) just work. Currently, I'm building <a href="https://sidekic.zimfy.co">Sidekic</a>, <a href="https://learnwithjiffy.com">Jiffy</a>, and a few other things that haven't launched yet. I am also an automation tinkerer, serial entrepreneur, husband, and father.

      I am available for consulting, project work, speaking engagements, and workshops. If you are interested in working with me, please reach out to me at via email at <code>josh@zimfy.co</code>
