        ðŸ‘‹ Josh here. I am the founder of <a href="https://zimfy.co">Zimfy</a>, a product studio dedicated to crafting products that (<span class="italic">mostly</span>) just work. Currently, I'm building <a href="https://securequest.io">Securequest</a>, <a href="https://sidekicai.com">SidekicAI</a>, <a href="https://learnwithjiffy.com">Jiffy</a>, and a few other things that haven't launched yet. I am also an automation tinkerer, serial entrepreneur, husband, and father.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am available for consulting, project work, speaking engagements, workshops, or <a href="https://joshcirre.jiffyfeed.com/feeds/hello-there">full-time employment.</a> I love being open about what I'm working on and what I'm looking forward to work on next, so that's exactly what you can find on my <a href="https://cir.re/suggest">Suggest.gg</a> page.
